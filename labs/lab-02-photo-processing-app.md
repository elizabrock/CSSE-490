# Lab 2: Photo Processing App

## Learning Goals / Objectives:

* Practice deploying an application
* Practice applying the steps we used last time (clone, push, deploy, etc) without instructions that are quite as explicit
* Practice using tests to guide your implementation
* Practice reading library documentation and using that reading to implement new things
* Practice a little creativity, too!

## Requirements:

* Your application must be deployed to Heroku
* Your application must accept an uploaded image and return a version of that image that has one or more effects applied to it via. Pillow
* Your work must be developed using the provided unit tests

## Getting Started:

Lab Starting Code (through GitHub Classroom): https://classroom.github.com/a/g_0XKdgO


### 1. Clone the code
### 2. Install dependencies

Follow the instructions in the README for this :)

(Note that they have slight differences from last time)

### 3. Run the application in development mode
### 4. Run the tests

`rake test`

### 5. Follow the instructions in the test output to implement the photo transformation(s) of your choice

### Step 5: Wrap up your work:

1. Commit your local changes
2. Push your code to *your* GitHub repository
3. Deploy your code to Heroku
4. Make sure that your changes are live in production
5. Turn in the lab to [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/)!
