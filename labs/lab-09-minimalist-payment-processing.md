## Learning Goals / Objectives:

My personal goal is for you all to be entrepreneurs.  To make money on the internet, you've got to be able to transact some business!

* Learn how to accept payments through your web application/web site


Note:  You will not be able to actually accept payments without signing up for a production account with a business EIN, etc.  However, this will teach you the fundamentals that you will be able to use in the future

## Requirements:

*  Your finished application should be able to accept payments in Sandbox Mode

## Getting Started:

1. Clone the code //TODO
