# Project Overview

The sky is the limit for project ideas. However, I will be helping you limit the initial scope of your projects to ensure that you are able to create something cool in the time allotted.

## Project Requirements

The #1 project requirement:  Make something damn cool!

* Must be something you (or someone you care about) deems genuinely cool/useful
  * Great: An app that combines the APIs for Spotify, a song lyrics service, and a sentiment analysis service to provide sentiment analysis of Spotify playlists or Spotify playlist history
  * Good: A service that emails you daily to ask how your day went, then emails you a weekly summary at the end of the week, perhaps using sentiment analysis and timestamps to glean a little data about how the user is feeling
  * Good: A pictographic cookbook for my little sister that can't read yet
  * Bad: A simple CRUD app to track the movies I've watched
* Must be a web application
  * A web application does not necessarily require a front-end at all-  see the example above about a service that interacts with the user solely via. email
* Must be accessible on the public internet
* Can be written in any combination of web technologies you wish
  * It does NOT need to use Flask or React.  We are using these tools in class to learn concepts, not to prescribe technological solutions

## Project Cadence

We will develop this project in a series of milestones and sprints.  We will start project ideation in Week 0, but we won't start actual coding until midway through the term.  Weeks 8-10 will be lighter on class materials, with labs that are either smaller or entirely optional, so you will have time to focus on developing your project.

* M1: Ideation
* M2: Settling on an idea and a team (optional, up to 2 students)
* M3 (likely splitting this into multiple milestones): Plan your application
    * How will users interact with your application?  (Basic wireframes are required, high fidelity mocks are NOT required)
    * What APIs will you need?
    * How will you structure your application?
    * How will you store and structure your data?
* M4 - MN-1: Weekly sprints with progress reports
* MN: Live presentations during our finals timeslot
